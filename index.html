            <h2>Early career</h2>
            <p>Tally Hall started out as the band ListedBlack, which included Rob Cantor, a guitarist and singer, and Zubin Sedghi, a bassist and singer, among other members no longer doing projects with them, it started around 2000-2001 and ended in 2002, this is when both Rob and Zubin graduated and formed the band Tally Hall with Andrew horowitz, a keyboardist and singer, not long after they met both Joe Hawley, a guitarist and singer, and Steve Gallagher, a former drummer that got replaced by Ross Federman a year later.</p>
            <h2>Albums</h2>
            <p>After the members had all gotten together, which are colour coded, Rob is yellow, Joe is red, Zubin is blue, Andrew is green and Ross is grey, they started writing many of the released and unreleased songs we know of today, a lot of them were scrapped or used in future side projects, but the released songs we have now come in 2 albums and 1 single, Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum and Good & Evil in the late 2000s and early 2010s and the single Just a friend in 2019, an unreleased cover of a song by the same name. All of the songs on those albums among other songs that never got released or got repurposed in other projects were used in their tours.</p>
            <p><strong>Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum</strong></p>
            <p>Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum is Tally Hall's first album, first released in 2005, then rereleased in 2006 and re-rereleased in 2008, which is the current version. They recorded music videos for most of the songs, which were included in their web comedy series <em>Tally Hall's Internet Show</em>. The album and the band in general gained a fair bit of traction on TikTok with the songs Ruler of Everything and Hidden In the Sand, which were responsible for getting the band very popular today. The album is named after the amusement park of the same name, Founded by Marvin Yagoda, which provides a line near the beginning of Welcome to Tally Hall, many of the songs are also based on or reference attractions at the museum.</p>
            <p><strong>Good & Evil</strong></p>
            <p>Good & Evil is Tally Hall's second album, first fully released in 2011. Its release took a while, with it being first announced in 2009 and fully completed in 2010. Its songs were very prominent in touring due to it taking another year for them to release the album. Turn the Lights Off also got very popular on TikTok and was also partially responsible for the gained popularity of the band</p>

            </div>    
            <h2>Side projects</h2>
            <p>After the members went on hiatus in late 2011, the members started working on their side projects. Joe released 2 albums, one titled Hawaii Part II which was made by Joe, Ross and Bora Karaca, one of the touring and production assistants for the band, under the artist name Miracle musical, released in 2012. It used old demos and unreleased songs from tally hall a lot in its production, there was also a single that released prior the album that's closely related to it, the other is titled Joe Hawley Joe Hawley which was released under his own name in 2016 but didn't get released on spotify until 2020 for legal reasons, it's mostly a solo project, he also released a few singles under the same name. Rob released Not A Trampoline, a solo project which also included some repurposed demos and unreleased songs and released in 2014, he has also done a lot of work for Disney. Andrew released a few projects, he released Sketches in 2012 under the name edu, which got remastered and rereleased in 2019 under the name Sketches 3D, he also released a few singles under the same artist that same year, he also released Etudes and Etudes II in 2018 and 2019 respectively under his own name.</p> 
            <h2>The future of the band</h2>
            <p>Tally Hall will possibly make another album or tour more, but it's currently not feasible as Joe Hawley is struggling with mental health and has seperated himself from the band more and more over the years, while nothing is confirmed, there may be more side projects in the future.</p>
